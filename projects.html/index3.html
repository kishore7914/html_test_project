           <p> 
            The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. 
            It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his
            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque 
            and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Taj Mahal, mausoleum 
            complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān
            (reigned 1628-58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, 
            having been the emperors inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612

        <h2>Southern Gateway</h2>

          <p>
            The southern end of the complex is graced by a wide red sandstone gateway with a recessed central arch two stories high.
            White marble paneling around the arch is inlaid with black Qurānic lettering and floral designs. The main arch is flanked
            by two pairs of smaller arches. Crowning the northern and southern facades of the gateway are matching rows of white chattris
           (chhattris; cupola-like structures), 11 to each facade, accompanied by thin ornamental minarets that rise to some 98 feet 
           (30 metres). At the four corners of the structure are octagonal towers capped with larger chattris

         <h2>Marble Portal</h2>
        <p>
            Two notable decorative features are repeated throughout the complex: pietra dura and Arabic calligraphy. As embodied in the
             Mughal craft, pietra dura (Italian: “hard stone”) incorporates the inlay of semiprecious stones of various colours, including
            lapis lazuli, jade, crystal, turquoise, and amethyst, in highly formalized and intertwining geometric and floral designs. The
            colours serve to moderate the dazzling expanse of the white Makrana marble. Under the direction of Amānat Khan al-Shīrāzī, verses
            from the Qurān were inscribed across numerous sections of the Taj Mahal in calligraphy, central to Islamic artistic tradition.
            One of the inscriptions in the sandstone gateway is known as Daybreak (89:28–30) and invites the faithful to enterparadise.
            Calligraphy also encircles the soaring arched entrances to the mausoleum proper. To ensure a uniform appearance from the
            vantage point of the terrace, the lettering increases in size according to its relative height and distance from the viewer.
